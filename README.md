# Grid Builder

  
  Grid builder is a project created for uploading an image and creating a grid layout using the image.
  The configured grid can be used for making grid based video games or grid 
  based location tracking applications.
  
  
  A generated grid can be downloaded as a JSON file and used as is. The JSON file contains both the 
  settings and grid along with space names and the original image.
